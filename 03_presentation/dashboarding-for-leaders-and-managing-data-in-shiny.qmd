## Dashboard Design Principles {.smaller}

Effective dashboard design ensures that the audience can quickly absorb critical information and make informed decisions. Here are the key principles:

<!-- <br> -->

#### 1. **Understand the *Purpose*, *Audience* and *Context* **

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
#### 2. **Simple & Clear Visual Elements**
   - Opt for simple and effective visualizations.
   - Too many graphs or charts = cognitive overload.
   - Consider interactivity so the user can explore.

## Dashboard Design Principles {.smaller}

<br>

##### 3. **Prioritization of Information**
   - Ensure that decision-making data is accessible at a glance.
   - Use size, position, and color to draw attention to key metrics.

<br>

##### 4. **Balance Timely Data against Speed of App**
   - Minimize data operations within app session
   - Maximize user's ability to see timely data 
   - What does "Timely Data" mean for you projects? 

## Dashboard Design Principles {.smaller}

<br>

##### 5. **Consistency**
   - Consistent formatting, fonts, and **color** schemes.
   - Consistent types of charts for similar types of data to foster familiarity.

<br>

##### 6. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure the dashboard is easy to use, even for individuals who may not be highly technical.
   - Use color contrast and design elements that are accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments.
   - Provide tooltips or brief explanations for more complex metrics.

## CRUD Apps in R and Shiny

### Start with your logical model
![](images/logical-model.png)

### Design CRUD tables
![](images/crud_conferences.png){width=12%}
![](images/crud_teams.png){width=35%}
![](images/crud_players.png){width=35%}


## CRUD Apps in R and Shiny {.smaller}

Check out `R_workshop > app.R`

- Use {rhandsontable}, {reactable}, or {DT} to display selectable/editable tables
- Control user submissions through `shiny::actionButton`s
- Validate user input using functions, such as `shiny::req`, `shiny::validate`, `shinyfeedback::feedback`, and `shiny::showNotification`
- A CRUD app could have the following key steps:
    1. Read in data
    2. Join and transform data into user table(s), using a function
    3. Make your user table to a reactive object, using `reactiveValues`
    4. Upon user submission, there are two subprocesses:
    
    - Transform submission back into original raw table structure, using a function, then write to data
    - Update your reactive user table with submission
