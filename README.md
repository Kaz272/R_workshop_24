# PUB Sector R Workshop 2024: Dashboarding for Leaders and Managing Data in Shiny

## Overview

The **PUB Sector R Workshop 2024** is designed to facilitate a 1-day workshop, focusing on working with your organizationâ€™s data from data collection to data management to data visualization. Participants will learn how to build a dashboard with Shiny, including dynamic calendars perfect for large-scale event tracking. Additionally, the workshop covers building a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application that allows users to manage data themselves. We will also discuss concepts such as multi-tiered architectures, modularizing code, clear data visualizations, and managing user permissions in Shiny apps.
